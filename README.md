# Java Allergies

#### By _Ming Wen_

## Description

An allergy score is a single number that tells what someone is allergic to. The scores for each allergen are:

    allergen     score
    eggs         1
    peanuts      2
    shellfish    4
    strawberries 8
    tomatoes     16
    chocolate    32
    pollen       64
    cats         128

So if someone is allergic to eggs and strawberries, they get a score of 9.

This is a website that uses a method that takes someone's score and returns an array listing what they're allergic to. For example, app.allergies(3) would return ["eggs", "peanuts"].
